Privacy and Security Policy

Letter from our founders

As users of the internet, we care about privacy just like you. And as fellow human beings, we think you deserve to know exactly what you can expect from your Email Protector experience. Before you read our privacy policy, we’d first like to tell you how we think about privacy in simple terms.

We do not sell personal information about anyone who uses our services. Ever. That would not be fair.

We created Email Protector in 2019 because the existing model for online web security does not work well for most people. Often times people fall victim to not so technically advanced, but persistent malicious actors, who exploit pepople's very own sence of moral and duty.

So we decided to build a community that uses the collective insights of our users and members to power tools that allow everyone to do their job smarter, together. Similar to applications that enable commuters to cut through traffic and save time, which are powered by their users and members providing information about speed and congestion, Email Protector users share real-time data about malicious actors who try to take advantage of one's negligence. Making a transaction to someone who pretends to be your business partner often times relies on people being tricked into sending money to another payment address. Our top priority is to have you not fall a victim.

We understand this community network approach is not for everyone and that is okay.

We help people who have successful businesses and lead tons of corresponcence a day, because verification of email data could often take more time than one can spare.

Our stance on privacy is simple: We will be always transparent with you. 

If this sounds fair, we would like to help you earn more by staying safe!

Georgi Spasov
CEO, Online Corpus Industries

P.S. If you have any questions or comments, we are always listening at privacy@onlinecorpus.com.

The Extension has specific business logic. Users may "trust" specific emails that they store locally within their applicaiton. Whenever there is an email that falls into a specific criteria match, and is marked as malicious for that purpose, the user shares the malicious email with the company for future work and protection of other customers. In this scope, we will not collect message informaion, meta informaion such as timestamps, message attachments and browser informaion.
Click-stream events in the context of a browser may or may not be collected whenever there is a call to a specific function of the Extension. Such click-stream events will not include user actions in the browser, but rather will be limited to the presented application made inside the container.
