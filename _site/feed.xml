&lt;p&gt;An ongoing sextortion campaign targeting thousands around the United States infects victims with the GandCrab ransomware and demands $500 to decrypt their systems.
&lt;p&gt;Sextortion emails typically ask for money in order to keep silent about compromising adult websites that they supposedly looked at. But this particular campaign takes it a step further, by attaching a link which when clicked then installs the infamous GandCrab ransomware.
&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;


“In general, *sextortion* emails simply demand payment to avoid publication of the purported evidence of compromising information,” Proofpoint researchers said in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/sextortion-side-ransomware&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Friday post&lt;/a&gt;. “However, this week Proofpoint researchers observed a sextortion campaign that also included URLs linking to AZORult stealer that ultimately led to infection with GandCrab ransomware.&quot;


Researchers, who first spotted the campaign Dec. 5, said it involved thousands of messages that were sent to targets primarily in the U.S.


Victims received email messages from bad actors who claimed to have compromising information about the victims’ activities on adult websites.


The message then threatens to expose a range of the supposedly observed illicit activities, and offers a link where victims can see a “video presentation” of the adult sites and screenshots of themselves (which the bad actors say were taken via the camera on the victims’ device).


“The supposed password for the potential victim’s email address in this case appears to be the same as the email account,” researchers said. “Therefore, in this case it may simply be a bluff and the attacker does not actually possess the victim’s password.”


GandCrab has continued to make infosec headlines over the past year, in August taking aim at South Korean victims through emails with EGG attachments, while in May the GandCrab payload was found hiding on legitimate but compromised websites.


The ransomware continues to be profitable: According to research in March by Check Point, the group behind GandCrab has infected over 50,000 victims, mostly in the U.S., U.K. and Scandinavia. And in the first two months that the ransomware crew had been in business, criminals earned up to $600,000.


To avoid such sextortion scams, researchers warned that email users should assume that senders to not possess any screenshots of compromising activity, and should avoid clicking links to verify the sender’s claims.

The person must be detail-oriented, curious, intelligent and hard-working, and with a quick reaction time as constant attacks unfold. These analysts have deep expertise that they use during their long shifts to sort through what’s worth investigating and what can be safely ignored. They are an impressive bunch, but they are only human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;security-barriers-and-tactics&quot;&gt;Security Barriers and Tactics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenges facing the security operations center (SOC) are numerous: Today’s volume of cyberattacks and network activity make it impossible for them to monitor all security alerts; and, they are only given enough time to consider very few factors for the alerts they do look at. This results in missed incidents, long dwell time for attackers and many false positives that waste the security team’s time and attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reality reduces the security posture for the enterprise. It takes the typical organization 197 days to identify that their IT environment has been compromised, the Ponemon Institute found in its 2018 Cost of A Data Breach Study. The total cost of containing, investigating and repairing a breach averages $3.86 million, or $148 per lost or stolen record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, the cost of a breach is proportional to how long it goes on undetected. The more quickly the breach is discovered and contained, the lower the overall cost to the victim. Incidents that are fully resolved within 30 days cost an average of $1 million less to remediate than those taking more time. Unfortunately, the trend is moving in the wrong direction, as it’s taking companies longer to identify and contain the data breaches they’re being confronted with than it did last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put simply, there are three primary barriers that prevent security analysts from being able to make instant decisions as data is streamed real-time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Excessive information and data to process&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Insufficient meaning—we don’t understand what the data is telling us, and the log files often don’t contain useful information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inadequate memory — we can’t remember details from two hours ago, let alone days, weeks or months earlier.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-ways-to-maximize-your-soc&quot;&gt;7 Ways to Maximize Your SOC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Make your data work for you.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you getting real value from all that data you’re collecting? If you’re not using it to inform decision-making logic, it’s not doing you any good. With today’s security operations software, autonomous analysis is possible, and this can give you the opportunity to make a revolutionary change in how you use log data. What’s important is how well you monitor, employ and analyze it to recognize malicious activity in your environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Join the small data movement.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some SecOps teams collect information from more than a hundred data sources – monitoring everything from endpoint operating system events to router status logs. But more than 99.99 percent of this data is never put to any use. This dramatically increases your costs without appreciably improving your security posture. A better method is to collect only what you need and then actually use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Measure what’s relevant.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how large the enterprise it belongs to, and no matter how much the business has invested in security technologies, some attacks will always succeed. Infosec leaders often produce metrics that demonstrate how hard they’re trying to prevent breaches—which is not really relevant anymore. And CISOs often use threat metrics to justify their (traditionally underfunded) budgets. Instead, leaders need to ask more penetrating questions about the value they derive from their investments in security operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Prepare to expect the unexpected.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cybercriminals will try to target vulnerabilities that they know are considered low-priority risks. These are so numerous, and so often unexpected, that it’s nearly impossible to anticipate all the attacks that can be launched against them. Tabletop exercises and red teaming can be tremendously valuable in this area. What is your mega-breach response plan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Don’t rely on peer organizations; instead, reimagine active defense.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedures and workflows used to safeguard our businesses are, for the most part, simply not working. Much of the thinking – and benchmarking – that your fellow business leaders do center around the concept of having reasonable protections in place. Instead, we must reimagine what it means to defend ourselves in a digital world. Successful defense requires you to take an active and anticipatory approach to the inevitable attacks you will experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Stop merely managing human failures.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts and managers make a hard job harder when they conceal operational failures, fail to disclose known vulnerabilities or create a dishonest organizational culture. Instead, make your SOC a place where employees can be honest about what they find without worrying about getting fired. And incorporating automation and security analysis software into places in your SOC where human failures commonly occur can greatly improve its overall operational efficiency and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. Language matters.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not a “virus” – a rapidly multiplying microscopic parasite – that’s on your network. And it’s not just “malware” – something inanimate – that’s in your environment. There are human criminals taking deliberate action, via malicious code, and their intent is to do you harm. We need to recognize the seriousness, gravity and human origin of the threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Better at Addressing Threats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyberattacks will persist, and fighting them will remain a constant battle. Use the seven points listed above to create an effective and efficient operational workflow and, importantly, happier analysts who aren’t buried at the bottom of a pile of mostly irrelevant data.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>georgi</name></author><category term="cybercrime" /><category term="data" /><summary type="html">It takes a special sort of person to be a security analyst.

And it’s happening with more convincing content and greater accuracy due to Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine learning, and Big Data. And while IT leaders are using AI to take security to the next level, what if this technology falls into the wrong hands- the bad guys?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dawn of the internet and advances in computing means we’re able to trigger an exact solution to complex problems in diverse areas - ranging from astrophysics and biological systems to automation and precision. But at the same time, these systems are inherently vulnerable to cyber threats. In this fast-paced world where innovations come and go in the blink of the eye, cybersecurity remains top-of-mind, especially for companies dabbling with data-rich transformations such as the Internet of Things (IoT).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To a large extent, cybersecurity relies on file signatures to detect malware, and rules-based systems for detecting network abnormalities. Protection often stems from an actual virus outbreak – as security experts isolate the malicious files and identify unique signatures that help other systems become alert and immune. The same is true for the rules-based system: Rules are set based on experience of potential malicious activity, or systems are locked down to restrict any access to stay on the safe side. The only problem with these approaches is their reactive nature. Hackers always find innovative ways to bypass the known rules. Before a security expert discovers the breach, it’s often too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cybersecurity-shaken-up-by-ai&quot;&gt;Cybersecurity shaken up by AI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/cybersec-shaken-by-ai.jpg.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Cybersecurity shaken up by AI&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional malware is designed to perform its damaging functions on every device they find their way into. One example is the NotPetya ransomware outbreaks, in which hundreds of thousands of computers were infected in a short period of time. This method works when the attacker’s goal is to inflict maximum damage. It’s not as effective if an attacker has a specific target in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the advent of disruptive technologies like Artificial Intelligence means our devices and applications are understanding us better. For example, an iPhone X uses AI to automatically recognize faces. While it’s a great feature, it creates an intricate puzzle where the chances of sensitive data going in wrong hands are high. Today, hackers are seen using the same technology to develop smart malware that can prey on targets by pinpointing them from millions of users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ai-the-game-changer-in-security&quot;&gt;AI: The Game-Changer in Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/technology-ai-game-changer.jpg.webp&quot; alt=&quot;AI - The game changer in security&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; width=&quot;626&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With each passing year, attacks are getting more personalized with a higher likelihood of success. Hackers have even started using AI to accelerate polymorphic malware, causing code to constantly change and make it undetectable. Advanced tactics allow hackers to work around security to bypass facial security and spam filters, promote fake voice commands, and bypass anomaly detection engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is this intelligence be used to protect the infrastructure as well. What makes AI cybersecurity unique is its adaptability. Intelligent cybersecurity doesn’t need to follow specific rules. Rather, it can watch patterns and learn. Even better, AI can be directly integrated into everyday protection tools – such as spam filters, network intrusion and fraud detection, multi-factor authentication, and incident response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI truly has become a game-changer for cybersecurity. Making cyber protection more effective, here are several specific areas where artificial intelligence can help:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine Learning - AI and machine learning (ML) are two different worlds; in fact, machine learning can be considered a subset of AI mainly used to enhance intelligence. When it comes to improving its cybersecurity, it automatically fills the skills gap to prevent cyber-attacks. If any malicious software is detected on the network, automatic incident response is sent. In addition, specific AI bots block access to websites completely. By preventing such actions, AI improves the security of an organization or individual on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Analysis - Data is the key to a successful cyber environment. Artificial Intelligence has the potential to identify the right data that gets the best result. With advanced data from these tools, we gain more comprehensive understanding of cyber threats at hand - determining the best practices to mitigate threats proactively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merging Technical and Human Approaches - The most powerful security approach combines the power of AI and human intervention. Machine learning is a great example. Artificial Intelligence helps break down complex automatic process for detecting attacks and reacting appropriately. But the ultimate challenge is delivering measurable results in methods that can then anticipate and detect attacks – and later analyze and prevent. As key functions are automated through such approaches as machine learning, this allows security experts to focus their attention on other areas to build a proactive and more reliable cyber defense plan based on data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-look-in-the-future&quot;&gt;A look in the future&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity and artificial intelligence will continue to evolve, but so will the persistence and innovation of hackers trying to access your data.

&lt;p&gt;Every July in Bulgaria hides its own secrets. Last year, there was a major operation against child molesters and this year… Well, this year was marked by the marvelous deeds of some people (and the lack of security built into the applications that got cracked, but more of that below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July was a fruitful month. Several hacking stories made the first pages in just a couple of weeks. And since I hate spreading rumors and I started hating pointing my finger at people for no particular reason, here is a short summary of what happened:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, a ‘hacker’ from Stara Zagora published a video that was shared in the Bulgarian developers’ community (well, mainly in Facebook that is). He pointed out that he might have gotten access to the personal data of some citizens from his home town. There was also a POC GitHub repository, containing a Node application that generated valid personal identification numbers (or EGN), then the app fired those EGNs to the backend of the Stara Zagora municipality service that handled child subscriptions to kindergartens and schools. By making a crafted query, a person could be able to obtain personal data of approx 235000 people.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Petko Petkov's public facebook profile&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/hackers-have-hacked-what.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;lozad img-thumbnail&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;355&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The photo is taken from Petko Petkov's public facebook profile&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since pointing out the evident was basically a crime, according to the Prosecutors office, he got locked away by the local police department for 24hrs and set free after. The Prosecutors Office started working on building evidence against unknown perpetrator that ‘illegally’ (mind the quotes) gained access to personal data — a computer crime according to Article 319a of the Bulgarian Penal Code, but finally dropped the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Next, just two weeks after the previous ‘incident’, in mid-July we had a case of an unknown perpetrator that sent and email from the Russian platform Yandex to several Bulgarian mass-medias. The email stated that the cyber security state of Bulgaria is laughable, and it contained a link to the anonymous file sharing platform, that lead to a .zip file, containing over 11GB of Bularian citizens’ personal data.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Investigators held responsive a 20-year old teenager that supposedly stole the information from several National Revenue Agency databases. Officials demanded that the stolen data was returned in one piece (they did not get the concept of ‘stealing’).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, this, 20-year old ‘hacked’ his way into the database by using an SQL-injection — or at least that’s what was circulating in the media recently.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Alleged Hacker&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/teenager-alleged-hacker.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;lozad img-thumbnail&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;355&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The teenager that ‘hacks’ — according to mass media — photo from btv.bg&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Fortunately, he’s sound and safe, working from home, after a wee less than 72hrs behind bars. His personal laptops and his work laptop were seized, and later it was found out that they are encrypted. Aaaand that’s it, no harm done. The Revenue Agency stated that the data of 5 MILLION PEOPLE WAS NOT A PART OF THEIR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE (well then, if the personal data of 5 million is not critical enough…). And the boy was set free. Of course, the teenager and his employer mind their own business, and refuse to share data on the case with government officials, referring to ISO 27001, stressing the fact that they hold crucially important information about their contractors and partners.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The leaked data includes personal information such as identification numbers (those EGNs we were talking about just above), names, addresses, tax and revenue data, parking tickets and penalties… Well the last two are off the list, but you get the idea. Any smart enough criminal could utilize this treasure to do damage or will try to gain something from them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The grumpy person in me states and demands justice for all harm done! No one should go unpunished…
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yeah, but try decrypting a LUKS partition with some random or pseudo random password. I bet it will take the police a few decades to see what truly is going on (and that is if they use a few super servers). Heck, even my Fedora needs to cool the steam when I try to unlock it unsuccessfully several times.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We had some cyber businessmen talking about how real hackers used Linux, and that the traces left behind were from a Windows machine (well, obviously someone has not heard of VMware Workstation… 21 Century’s knocking on the door — Wakey wakey!). Leaving behind the humorous people that tend to stick their noses in places where they don’t belong is a great idea. But the ferocious public wants more. Every day numerous posts find their way to the top of the Facebook developer community list, pointing out different thought-up facts about the investigation. Well, that could prove useful for the investigators. I mean, people need a good laugh from time to time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, eventually, as I see things, that teenager is going to be cleared of all charges, with a decent story to tell his children… or ladies. Either way, after a week everyone will have forgotten. Or, if the Police and prosecutors office do indeed find data regarding any illegal activity, he might face some serious jail time. Either way, time will tell.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One thing is certain, though. Bulgarian citizens data will not be safe any time soon... Now all we need is a platform that will allow us to see just how much lateral damage we have to handle. :) I doubt that there will be any cyber-specific initiatives, having in mind the poor state of the Penal code and all the problems Bulgarian police officers suffer.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Despite all that, we keep our spirits high, quoting some random minister’s shower thoughts, shared publically: &lt;b&gt;“The data breach is not that harmful! The most important thing is to be alive and healthy!”&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Well, cheers to that!

&lt;b&gt;Email protector&lt;/b&gt; is a browser extension that mitigates &lt;b&gt;phishing, spear phishing and whaling attacks&lt;/b&gt;. It is designed to protect you when you do your day-to-day tasks. Instead of wasting time validating email headers by hand, Email Protector does that for you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is Email Protector?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email protector is a browser extension that gets installed… on your browser. Statistics show that the most commonly used browser is Google Chrome – that is why we designed the extension to be functional with that browser. The current release supports English, German and Bulgarian languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What does Email Protector do?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a browser extension, you should give permission to the Protector to read the headers of the emails you receive. The extension will not touch any other line of text besides the email header. By scanning the header, Email Protector will find out if the email is coming from a legitimate source or not. If an email comes from a non-legitimate source (like the method used in this article), then the extension will inform the user about the maliciously crafted email.
But what if the email comes from a legitimate source?
Let’s say that you’re having a nice business conversation with &lt;b&gt;businessmail1@gmail.com&lt;/b&gt;. You arrange payment information, exchange invoices and payment information and all of a sudden you get an email from &lt;b&gt;businessmali1@gmail.com&lt;/b&gt; (mind the changed email name) or &lt;b&gt;businessmail@gmali.com&lt;/b&gt; (the username remains the same, but the domain is changed). This is one of hacker’s favorite methods that trick you into believing that you’ve communicating with the legitimate person or entity. You can find a detailed article about this method here.
We’ve included functionality that can protect you from those “misspelled” emails, regardless of the fact if the username or domain name was forged.
You, as the user of the Extension, can “trust” specific email addresses – the ones that you know for sure are legitimate. You can do it by highlighting an email in the Chrome browser, right-clicking it and choosing “Trust email”. The email you have trusted will be stored in the memory of the extension, and you will see the email populate the list of “trusted emails”.
The standard version of the extension includes one slot for “trusted emails”, while the premium versions include three, ten or unlimited supported “trusted emails”.
That way, if you have trusted a specific email, let’s say business@mycompany.org, and you receive other emails from users such as busniess@mycompany.org or business@mycopmany.org, you will be notified about the fact that the email senders are not the same. This notification is going to be persistent whenever you open such an email, so that you are constantly reminded of the difference in the email names and / or domains.
If you make an error adding an email, you can always remove the email from the list of trusted emails by clicking on it and then selecting “remove email” from the button below.
Additional functionality includes the proactive prevention of phishing and spam campaigns by some domains. If a domain is used for malicious purposes, we collect the email address, which is related with the spam or phishing campaign, and proactively silently inform all Email Protector clients.
Protecting yourself means protecting other as well. We take great care in not exposing any information whatsoever that could compromise anyone as an entity or an individual. That is why we do not collect any user-specific information.
Security is something that should not be compromised on. Whenever there is a malicious email that you have received, Email Protector gathers the information, such as email user name and email domain (if the email is not spoofed), to inform other Email Protector instances across the globe for the existing threat. If the email is spoofed, Email Protector creates a local cache-like blacklist. This feature is user-centric and takes user security to a whole new level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Who can benefit from email protector?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extension is designed for day-to-day use by individuals and companies. If you’re using a browser and receiving 20+ emails daily, you’ll most probably not have enough time to go over email headers manually. That’s why we strongly recommend that you use or product. Just stay secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Can I use Email Protector on all email platforms?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently Email Protector is limited to &lt;b&gt;abv.bg&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;mail.bg&lt;/b&gt; and Google’s &lt;b&gt;gmail.com&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What are the supported platforms?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Chrome extension, currently the Email Protector could be installed on Google Chrome browsers, thus making it platform-independent (you can use it on Mac, Linux or Windows).
In the near future, we will make the Extension interoperable with Mozilla Firefox as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Where can I download Email Protector from?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the extension in the Chrome Web Store. It’s publicly available and free for use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Is there a security training video?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currnently not, but as soon as we upload it, everything will be uploaded here for easier refference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Where can we report bugs or feature ideas?&lt;/h3&gt;

What is whaling?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whaling is not only the favourite sport of the Japanese, but a type of cyberattack that uses the &lt;a title=&quot;Spear phishing&quot; href=&quot;https://onlinecorpus.com/spear-phishing-attacks/&quot;&gt;spear-phishing methods&lt;/a&gt; to go after a high-profile target. Also known as the CEO-fraud, whaling is almost the same as spear-phishing but the difference is that it uses methods such as email and website spoofing to trick the victim into performing specific actions, such as revealing sensitive data or wire transfer. Due to the evolving technologies everything becomes possible because of online communication and as &lt;i&gt;Homer Simpson&lt;/i&gt; once said “The problem with the world today is communication…too much communication.”
So on one hand &lt;a title=&quot;All you need to know about phishing&quot; href=&quot;https://onlinecorpus.com/everything-you-should-know-phishing-campaigns/&quot;&gt;phishing scams&lt;/a&gt; target random individuals and spear-phishing targets specific individuals or organizations and on the other hand whaling &lt;b&gt;goes to the next level&lt;/b&gt; by targeting the chosen victim in such a way that the fraudulent communications they send appear to have come from someone that is high ranked at their organization, such as the CEO or finance manager, or the so called “big fishes”. This type of scam requires a lot of preparation and research so to be executed successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do whaling attacks work and how do we prevent such scams?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, whaling attacks need &lt;b&gt;more detailed research and careful planning&lt;/b&gt; than standard phishing and spear-phishing attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all perpetrators look at &lt;b&gt;social media&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;public company information&lt;/b&gt; to establish a profile and plan of attack. For this purpose they usually use &lt;b&gt;malware&lt;/b&gt; to infiltrate the targeted network so that they can gather detailed information about the victim. To impersonate a high-value target, the cybercriminals need to take time to figure out the best way to sound like their target, find a way to approach their target, and figure out what kind of information they can get from the victims before the actual attack takes place. So when time comes the perpetrators send emails with much detail for example of a future payment in which they redirect a payment to a different bank account using the exact same writing style and invoices as the original email. So in these cases, the sender’s email address typically looks like it’s from a believable source/ CEO, business partner,senior manager etc./and may even contain corporate logos,original invoices or links to a fraudulent website that has also been designed to look legitimate. Usually A whaling attack will often use a domain name that looks very much like a trusted domain name, but with subtle and almost imperceptible changes. Because a whale’s level of trust and access within their organization tends to be high, it’s worth the time and effort for the cybercriminal to put extra effort into making the experience as casual as it can be.
Due to the rising levels of cybercrime in the recent years businesses must be aware of these kind of cyber attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What measures could be taken to increase the level of security and awareness among the employees of corporations?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all defending against whaling attacks starts with educating key figures within your organization to ensure they are routinely on guard about the possibility of being targeted. Also encouraging key staff members to maintain a healthy level of suspicion when it comes to unsolicited contact is a must, especially when it comes to important information or financial transactions.
Employees should also be trained to look out for the telltale signs of an attack, such as spoofed (fake) email addresses and names. Simply hovering a cursor over a name in an email reveals its full address. 
By looking carefully, it’s possible to spot if it perfectly matches the company name and format. Our email protector will do the job even if you are having a bad day and you don’t have the spare time to hover stuff on the monitor around.
Senior staff members and executives should keep in mind that cybercriminals can you every bit of information they are posting and sharing online on social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. Details such as &lt;b&gt;birthdays, hobbies, holidays, job titles, promotions and relationships can all be used by cybercriminals to craft more sophisticated attacks.&lt;/b&gt;
You can reduce the danger posed by spoof emails by requiring your IT department to automatically flag emails for review that come in from outside your network. Or just create a spam filter, so that messages from domains, which are not verified by Google get swept right away. But never mind that investor that just got into web design and IT stuff…
Or just you can use our Email Protector - the browser extension that will keep all kinds of phishing, spear-phishing and whaling attacks away from you.
One more thing to consider is adding another level of validation when it comes to sharing sensitive information or wiring a large amount of funds. For example, &lt;b&gt;a quick phone call may be the best practice when handling critical or sensitive tasks&lt;/b&gt;, rather than simply carrying out the transaction electronically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Things to keep in mind about whaling attacks:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A whaling attack will often use a domain name that looks very similar to the trusted domain name, but with subtle and almost imperceptible changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should research whether the specific domain has been bought recently OR has a newly utilized MX record — these things often times give away suspicious activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suspicious keywords in the body of the message, are often phrases such as “bank transfer” or “wire transfer”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Statistics show a great progress for this kind of attack over the rest several years&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since 2013, more than $12 billion has been unwittingly sent by 78,617 firms through the successful exploitation of CFOs and finance leaders in the U.S., UK and Europe. – A research made by Forbes magazine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The FBI reported that companies lost nearly $215 million in 2014 as a result of phishing attacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whaling attack instances are on the rise in the U.S., up more than 270% from January to August 2015. The FBI reports that business losses due to a whaling attack totaled more than $1.2 billion in just over two years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2016, the Verizon DBIR reported 61 phishing attacks targeting finance teams. That number rose to 170 in 2017 – nearly a 200% increase!
According to cyber security provider Smarttech 247, the number of whaling attacks tripled in 2017, with companies of all sizes being targeted.&lt;/li&gt;

If you leave the technical aspect aside, the one thing that gets most people is the false sense of security, overconfidence and trust. Yeah, people trust people they haven’t even seen in their life. That’s what the 21. Century is all about.
Being secure in such an insecure world seems the most absurd thing ever.
But somehow it’s all working out in the end. We are making progress and business is thriving.
Trust is what defines us as people, gives us power to overcome differences and solve almost unsolvable problems, but it can also be exploited for the most vile things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
You trust your friends, right? And if your friend uses the email address &lt;b&gt;samplefriend@example.com&lt;/b&gt;, and you are in constant connection together, you see nothing wrong in downloading an attached file, sent from &lt;b&gt;samplefreind@example.com&lt;/b&gt;, right?
Look into both emails and check if you can find something wrong.
That’s right. I’ve switched the places of two characters. I can tell you, a lot of people fell for this and clicked on the attached extension.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hackers love this. Misplacing one character in the domain name or in the username is one of the most common tactics hackers utilize to do &lt;a title=&quot;Spear phishing&quot; href=&quot;https://onlinecorpus.com/spear-phishing-attacks/&quot;&gt;spear phishing&lt;/a&gt; campaigns or whaing.
It’s a low risk, high profit strategy that, if executed correctly, gives a lot of leverage to the hackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of attack is almost uncatchable. Imagine you have an inbox full of a hundred emails per day. And you’ve got to verify every time that the email address is the correct one. That’s complete madness. A waste of time.
Our solution automates this validation. Email Protector uses several algorithms to verify the sender of the message and compare it to the email sender that you have trusted. The chrome extension is lightweight and you can download it in the chrome market FOR FREE.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
As you already know what a &lt;a title=&quot;Phishing attacks&quot; href=&quot;https://onlinecorpus.com/cyber-attacks-and-cybercrime-preventing-phishing/&quot;&gt;phishing attack and a &lt;a title=&quot;Phishing campaigns&quot; href=&quot;https://onlinecorpus.com/everything-you-should-know-phishing-campaigns/&quot;&gt; phishing campaign is&lt;/a&gt;, you got to know that there is nothing that can stop hackers in sending you an email.
Now the question is, how can you distinguish a harmful email from a regular one.
Since this article will be fairly technical, we’re not going to discuss the blatant and obvious give-aways of a phishing email, nor will we cover the previously discussed phishing campaigns.
As you already know what a phishing attack is, you got to know that there is nothing that can stop hackers in sending you an email.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the question is,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;how can you distinguish a harmful email from a regular one.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this article will be fairly technical, we’re not going to discuss the blatant and obvious give-aways of a phishing email, nor will we cover the previously discussed phishing campaigns.
If your cyber security solutions – name them antivirus products, malware blockers etc. fail to protect, the only thing that stands on the way between the cyber criminal and you, is a keyboard.
People nowadays have no accessible tool that can guarantee that the person, sending an email is the correct one. A hacker could forge the email so that it will seem as if it is sent by a legitimate institution or a person. But it’s actually not.
This tactic is often times utilized when a hacker group has taken the hold of an email account. Usually the compromised accounts are company accounts – as people pay little to no attention in following the security best practices, accounts often times get compromised and fall into the hands of hackers.
When those malicious actors have established control, they observe the correspondence between all parties. The emails hackers pay close attention to include keywords such as ‘payment’, ‘invoice’, ‘price’, ‘transaction’, ‘bank’.
After figuring out that a payment is soon to be made, hackers begin using the ‘bridge’ strategy.
As soon as the fundamental points of the strategy are complete, hackers begin either a social engineering or a spear phishing campaign against the other correspondent or they await an invoice to be received. 
Forging an invoice is really easy. That is why, one should&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Never wire a big sum of money before conducting a phone call&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a payment has been made, and if the recipient is fraudulent, one has a limited set of actions to do in order to recover from this situation.
But let’s not talk about the worst-case scenario. It is mandatory that everyone should know what to do, but more importantly, one should know how to proactively stop a threat before it’s too-late.
How do emails work is an article that will give you enough understanding and information, so that you won’t get confused by the acronyms and technical terms in the next lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Email servers with no spam filters - trouble for all of us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such email servers taht lack even basic antivirus protections or spam filters fall often times victim to spammers and phishing campaign.
Usually, a mail server should block and filter messages that have to &lt;b&gt;DKIM validation&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;SPF entries&lt;/b&gt;. In most cases, email servers that are misconfigured, do a standard SPF check, but when the SPF check fails, the email server does not block the email message. So, a malicious perpetrator gains access to the ‘Inbox’ of the unexpecting user.
Every year there are spam campaigns against the biggest free email service providers in Bulgaria – mail.bg and abv.bg. The lack of validation puts the users to a tremendous risk. Fortunately, users of Yahoo, Gmail and Microsoft Outlook are protected from emails that have no DKIM/SPF validation.
So, the attacker has gotten in the ‘Inbox’ folder of some email. His email got an attachment that will install a backdoor to an unpatched system. It’s our task to stop him do it.
Firstly, in order to verify that the email is coming from a legitimate source, and not some dubious online anonymous email service, we should check the email headers.
Email headers can’t lie to you. If the SPF or DKIM validation fails or softfails, it is surely that the sender is not a recognized source of email traffic.
The sending server might also give some information. We could check what we know about it online in just a few clicks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only when you examine an email message closely, can you fully understand what was going on when the email was sent. But verifying this information by hand every single time there is a new message in the inbox, is a tedious job.
If only there was a way to automate this check, regardless of the platform.. Well, there is! And our tool is free. You can read more about it here and download the chrome extension for free from the chrome web store.
Only then can you be sure that even if your email provider is not secure, you will minimize the risk by using the best free tools in the market.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>georgi</name></author><category term="phishing" /><category term="email" /><category term="data" /><category term="privacy" /><summary type="html">If you own a company or work for one, you know how business is organized – everything is happening via email.

What’s the trick, you’ll ask? Well, experience and common knowledge go hand in hand. And since hackers usually specialize at one area at a time, it’s really hard to know when one’s knowledge is sufficient enough and skills are technically advanced enough to conduct such an attack. Usually 95% of all spammers are just skids (script-kiddies are wannabe hackers with insuficient programming and systems knowledge). Yes, it may happen so that they catch a fish or two, but the really malicious actors are the one preparing months before a big hit.
Such a preparation has a lot of prerequites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 itemprop=&quot;articleSection&quot; class=&quot;h2-heading&quot;&gt;So how do hackers plan and execute campaigns?&lt;/h2&gt;

Bore continuing on, have you checked out the article that goes about &lt;a title=&quot;Cyber attacks and cybercrime: Preventing phishing&quot; href=&quot;https://onlinecorpus.com/cyber-attacks-and-cybercrime-preventing-phishing/&quot;&gt;what phishing is and how to prevent it?&lt;/a&gt; Check it out if you have not.
We’re not going to dive into some old cases of mine, as the technical details are overwhelming and this blogpost will be even hardly readable. I’d rather shed a light on what the Internet folks do.
To be fair, there is a gazillion ways to launch a campaign - and often times it occurs as spontaneous as it sounds. Of course, the results of such a campaign will be close to zero and the - withough previous planning a campaign such as this will be a total failure.
The &lt;b&gt;fruit bearing&lt;/b&gt; way that hackers often times adhere to, is to launch a campaign whenever they have gained enough data like names, emails, phone numbers. But that’s all random data - a phishing campaign is nothing more than collecting some data or even buying it and then using it for malicious purposes. During those campaigns, mailcious actors have no real idea who they will compromise. That’s the main difference with wailing or spear phishing.
So, whenever a phishing campaign is launched, it has the following goal:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Gain access to target sensitive information&lt;/b&gt; - A campaign often times start with a mass mail-spam. The messages aim to trick the user into revealing important data — often a username and password that the attacker can use to breach a system or account. The classic version of this scam involves sending out an email tailored to look like a message from a major bank; by spamming out the message to millions of people, the attackers ensure that at least some of the recipients will be customers of that bank. The victim clicks on a link in the message and is taken to a malicious site designed to resemble the bank's webpage, and then hopefully enters their username and password. The attacker can now access the victim's account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Download a malicious payload&lt;/b&gt; - This is a bit tricky for cyber criminals nowadays, as most email apps and big corporations – Yahoo, Google, Microsoft have their own security solutions that can protect users from harmful campaigns. Those messages almost always end up in spam or get deleted – depending on the user’s settings. That’s why malicious users target middle-sized and small companies that usually have some IT staff that manages the email server. Often times those email servers are neglected – even an update is a lux that the IT guys can’t afford to have. As you’ve probably guessed, most of those companies use open-source software that is reliable, but if left not updated could cause serious damage to the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving the admin stuff to the side, when a user gets a new message guess what happens? The user opens the email message – correct. Now, if the user sees that there is an attached file, he does what? Correct once more, he clicks and downloads the attached file. My personal observation shows that more than 80% of all users that have been infected and/or scammed have clicked and downloaded  an attached file.
If the user, runs a Windows OS instance on his laptop or tower, the chances that a malicious actor could gain access to the user’s system skyrocket. Don’t get me wrong – the Windows 10 team has repaired some of their Office Macro critical flaws that enabled macro execution and could carry some really harmful powershell functions, that in a flick of the command prompt could turn your computer into another hacked node – part of a botnet. It’s just wee bit difficult to make a Linux or a Mac user execute a file with root permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum it up – I’ve always advised people to think first. If you receive an email address from an ‘official institution’ - whether it would be the IRS, your Email provider or someone from your company, make sure that the message you’re getting has the correct sender – if not, you are being a target of a phishing campaign. And remember – official institutions always, ALWAYS send a paper copy of the documents to your physical mail.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>georgi</name></author><category term="phishing" /><category term="campaign" /><category term="data" /><category term="privacy" /><summary type="html">Real hackers plan every single step very carefully. What’s the trick, you’ll ask? Well, experience and common knowledge go hand in hand. And since hackers usually specialize at one area at a time, it’s really hard to know when one’s knowledge is sufficient enough and skills are technically advanced enough to conduct such an attack. Usually 95% of all spammers are just skids (script-kiddies are wannabe hackers with insuficient programming and systems knowledge). Yes, it may happen so that they catch a fish or two, but the really malicious actors are the one preparing months before a big hit. Such a preparation has a lot of prerequites.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://onlinecorpus.com/assets/images/posts/phishing-campaign-criminal.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://onlinecorpus.com/assets/images/posts/phishing-campaign-criminal.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html">What are spear phishing cyber attacks and how are they used</title><link href="https://onlinecorpus.com/spear-phishing-attacks/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What are spear phishing cyber attacks and how are they used" /><published>2019-04-23T00:00:00+03:00</published><updated>2019-04-23T00:00:00+03:00</updated><id>https://onlinecorpus.com/spear-phishing-attacks</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://onlinecorpus.com/spear-phishing-attacks/">&lt;p&gt;One of the most common methods cybercriminals use is the so called phishing – a cyber attack that is focused on getting access to one’s computer system, its passwords, also credit card data, bank accounts or other sensitive corporate information that could bring them easy money. To get this information cyber criminals are using email, social media, and any form of communication they can to gain access of and steal valuable data. You can find more about the broader term &lt;i&gt;phishing&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;What do we need to know about phishing&quot; href=&quot;https://onlinecorpus.com/cyber-attacks-and-cybercrime-preventing-phishing/&quot;&gt;in our previous article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
One specific type of cyber attack used by criminals is the spear-phishing. The target of the spear phishing attack is a specific individual or business. This attack is achieved by acquiring personal details on the victim such as their, hometown, employer, locations they frequently visit, and any other online activity they have, or in the other case, information about the business activity, payment methods, style of communication and business associates. The main goal is to deceive the target into clicking or downloading a malware, or into initiating an undesired action such as a wire transfer. Spear-phishing attacks are designed in such a way that the messages are modified to specifically address the victim, assuming that it comes from an entity that they are familiar with and containing specific, detailed personal information. Spear-phishing requires more research and time than phishing. The perpetrators try to obtain as much personal information about their victims as possible to make the emails they send look legitimate thus increasing their chance of fooling recipients. Because of the personal data that is included in the emails, spear-phishing attacks are more difficult to identify than phishing attacks (due to the broader range of the basic phishing attack).This is the reason why spear-phishing attacks are becoming more widespread.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How does spear phishing work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businesses are most vulnerable to spear-phishing attacks because most of their company data is public and freely available online. This makes the job of the hacker of getting the information needed to perform a phishing attack a piece of cake. The official website of a company and all the other social networks that it is connected to like facebook, linkedin, twitter are full with detailed information about the activity of the company, its ceos, managers employers, customers etc. In a spear-phishing email, these details available online can help the perpetrators to write their email in such a way that it would deceive the recipient enough to convince him to click the malicious link . Once the malware is downloaded the hackers are ready to capture sensitive internal-only data, thus allowing them to have free access to the corporate network and steal intellectual property, corporate data or even worse to easily redirect a payment to a criminal bank account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;So how do we prevent a spear-phishing attack?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing how to protect ourselves online is something that is becoming more and more important nowadays. We share personal information even more than we know or want. In an evolving world full of technology every company is obligated to ensure that its employees are well prepared against cyberattacks.
&lt;b&gt;Rule Number One&lt;/b&gt; is never to click open emails from senders you don’t know. While working, we get the habit to click and open every single email that we receive, but this is exactly what criminals are waiting for. This is the reason most of the scams succeed. When you receive a deceiving email you don’t even pay attention to the small details that are changed, like misspelled domain names and typos in the email name. This is costing businesses around the world millions of dollars.
Worldwide, thre is not one signle solution that manages this kind of attack. Well, fortunately for all of us, we’ve created a &lt;b&gt;free&lt;/b&gt; tool that can handle this troublesome situation. Our Chrome extension makes business email communication much more reliable and secure.
&lt;b&gt;Education&lt;/b&gt; is another important factor.Every company must educate its employees about the different types of cyberattacks and what to pay attention to when exchanging business emails. Senior management, key staff, and financial teams MUST be educated about the effects of spear-phishing and whaling attacks and how to spot them. These employees must be trained to spot the common characteristics of phishing attacks like spoofed senders, unrequested attachments, or spoofed hyperlinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other key factor is practise.  Employees must regularly be put through fake whaling attacks to test their knowledge and awareness. These small steps will improve significantly the safety of the business process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For additional online security you must adhere to these simple steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a few more seconds to create stronger passwords&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;Change passwords regularly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a two-step verification (2SV) or two-factor authentication (2FA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform regular scans on user and infrastructure systems for malware and keep the software up to date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you receive an email with changed details (bank accounts, phone numbers, location, addresses, recipients etc.) &lt;b&gt;always double check and personally contact the sender to confirm the changes&lt;/b&gt; - this means that you’ve got to put your fear of speaking with someone on the phone away, pick up the phone and make a simple call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the attackers is to make employees neglect the changes. Almost always emails like these contain the obvious sence of urgency - urgent reply, an urgent transaction or a specific urgent instruction that one should do.
In this way the employee has no time to react and think over the changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a hard thing keeping yourself safe. I’ll allow myself to rephrase Bruce Lee by saying that we should take great attention in the words one is using in his day-to-day communication with others. Stay sharp and don’t let yourself be trciked.
